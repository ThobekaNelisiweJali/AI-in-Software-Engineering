# Week 4 Assignment: AI in Software Engineering  
### Theme: Building Intelligent Software Solutions ðŸ’»ðŸ¤–

---

## Project Overview

This assignment explores the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in software engineering through a combination of **theoretical analysis**, **practical implementation**, and **ethical reflection**. The goal is to demonstrate how AI can automate repetitive tasks, enhance decision-making, improve software quality, and address ethical challenges.

---

## Objective

- Analyze AI applications in software engineering  
- Implement AI-powered tools for code completion, automated testing, and predictive analytics  
- Reflect on ethical issues in AI deployment  
- Propose innovative AI solutions beyond class content

---

## Project Structure

### Part 1: Theoretical Analysis (30%)  
- Short answer questions on AI code generation, machine learning, and bias mitigation  
- Case study on AI in DevOps (AIOps)

### Part 2: Practical Implementation (60%)  
- **Task 1:** AI-Powered Code Completion  
  Write and compare Python functions to sort a list of dictionaries using AI tools like GitHub Copilot.  
- **Task 2:** Automated Testing with AI  
  Automate login page tests using Selenium IDE or Testim.io with AI enhancements.  
- **Task 3:** Predictive Analytics for Resource Allocation  
  Train and evaluate a machine learning model on the Kaggle Breast Cancer Dataset.

### Part 3: Ethical Reflection (10%)  
- Discuss dataset bias and fairness mitigation strategies using tools like IBM AI Fairness 360.

### Bonus Task (Extra 10%)  
- Propose an AI tool solving a new software engineering problem.
